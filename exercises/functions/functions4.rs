// This store is having a sale where if the price is an even number, you get 10
// Rustbucks off, but if it's an odd number, it's 3 Rustbucks off. (Don't worry
// about the function bodies themselves, we're only interested in the signatures
// for now. If anything, this is a good way to peek ahead to future exercises!)
//
// Execute `rustlings hint functions4` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a
// hint.
